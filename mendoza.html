                                <p><a href="https://thibaudherem.com/collections" target="_blank">Thibaud Hérem</a> is a French illustrator based in London, celebrated for architectural drawings that are  almost obsessive in their precision. Working mostly with  pencil and Indian ink, he creates <strong>“portraits of  buildings”</strong> that feel alive with storytelling and history. His pieces can take anywhere from <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/bespoke-exclusive-collection-interviews-artist-thibaud-herem-on-how-his-intricate-landscapes-came-to-life-on-bespoke-panels">200 to 600 hours to complete,</a> a testament to both his passion and discipline.</p>

                                <p class="shane_netflix">His work journey began in graphic design in France, but he quickly shifted focus toward illustration— books like Know Your Rodent paved the way for more architectural commissions. Today, he&#39;s worked for  clients such as Samsung, Nike, Hermés, Four Seasons, and Netflix (notably <a href="https://www.preview.ph/culture/our-beloved-summer-choi-ung-art-thibaud-herem-a2142-20220127" target="_blank"><i>Our Beloved Summer</i></a>). He&#39;s  also exhibited globally and published books like Raising a Forest, London Deco and Story of Trees.</p>

                                <p class="citation">Togo Jinja</p>
                            </div>

                            <p>One of his private commissions, Togo Jinja is a shrine found just next to where Thibaud Hérem once  lived in Tokyo. He captured it with meticulous line work and subtle ink washes, bringing out both the  temple&#39;s historic dignity and its delicate charm—each column, rooftop tile, and shadow rendered with quiet  precision. In his own words, <strong>“Illustrating houses is like making a portrait of the house,”</strong> he once said, adding  that his details often hint at a building&#39;s social context, era, or personality. While he hasn&#39;t spoken about  this temple specifically in interviews, it reflects the care and intent behind his architectural work.</p>

                            <div class="blog3-image new-size">
                                <img src="assets/Sakura-branch.webp" alt="Sakura Branch" class="sakura-branch"/>
                                <p class="citation">Sakura Branch</p>
                            </div>

                            <p>Nature entered Thibaud Hérem&#39;s work more deeply during his time in Japan. While Sakura Branch  hasn&#39;t been discussed by name, his botanical illustrations were inspired by what he called the respect and  celebration of trees in Japanese culture. In an interview with <a href="https://www.formalelements.co.uk/features/thibaud-herem" target="_blank">Formal Elements,</a>  he said, <strong>“I started noticing  their shape and structure like I would a building.”</strong> That mindset is visible in the delicate flow of this  branch—carefully composed, yet alive with energy. The Sakura&#39;s cultural symbolism and fleeting beauty  seem  to  align  naturally  with  Hérem&#39;s  meditative   ink  process.</p>

                            <div class="blog3-image new-size">
                                <img src="assets/south-koreanpine.webp" alt="South Korean Pine " class="south-koreanpine"/>
                                <p class="citation">South-Korean Pine</p>
                            </div>

                            <p>The South-Korean Pine reflects Thibaud Hérem&#39;s shift toward botanical subjects, a move he made  after years of focusing almost exclusively on architecture. In an interview with <a href="https://www.formalelements.co.uk/features/thibaud-herem" target="_blank">Formal Elements,</a> he  explained that this change came from a desire to break away from the strict lines of buildings:</p>

                            <p><strong><i>“Trees became a subject when I needed a break from straight lines.” </i></strong></p>

                            <p>Though this particular tree hasn&#39;t been discussed by name, the work fits seamlessly into that phase  of his practice. It showcases his signature style—meticulously layered ink strokes that give the tree texture  and dimensionality, as if the bark itself has memory. Hérem treats the pine like an architectural form,  studying its angles, balance, and quiet authority. But there&#39;s softness, too—especially in the way the pine  needles arc gently downward. The result is a drawing that encourages stillness. It doesn&#39;t just show a tree;  it invites you to really see it.</p>

                                <img src="assets/bunjaemagnolia.webp" alt="Bunjae Magnolia" class="bunjae"/>
                                <p class="citation">Bunjae Magnolia</p>
                            </div>
                            <p>Bunjae Magnolia, drawn in Indian ink and watercolor, is a quiet yet intricate example of Thibaud  Hérem&#39;s growing body of botanical work. Though he hasn&#39;t spoken about this specific piece publicly, it  reflects the artistic shift he described in <a href="https://www.formalelements.co.uk/features/thibaud-herem" target="_blank">Formal Elements,</a> where he shared how drawing trees helped him  reset after years of rigid architectural focus.</p>

                            <p><strong><i>“Trees forced me to be more patient. You can&#39;t rush them—they don&#39;t make sense if you do.” </i></strong></p>

                            <p>This particular drawing, styled in the Korean bunjae tradition, captures that patience in visual form.  The precise linework and soft washes express both control and softness—the magnolia&#39;s petals unfurling  with a kind of restrained grace. Unlike his monumental buildings, this miniature subject invites close  observation. The composition holds a sense of stillness and rhythm, echoing Hérem&#39;s ongoing fascination  with repetition, detail, and time.</p>

                            <div class="blog3-image new-size">
                                <img src="assets/korean-aperitif.webp" alt="Korean Aperitif" class="aperitif"/>
                                <p class="citation">Shibuya Pact: Korean Aperitif</p>
                            </div>

                            <p>Originally titled Shibuya Pact, Korean Aperitif is one of Thibaud Hérem&#39;s looser, more atmospheric  pieces—created in 2020 using Indian ink and watercolor. Unlike his precisely rendered architectural  commissions, this piece leans into a more impressionistic style, with layered ink marks suggesting signage,  facades, or fragmented memories of urban space. While Hérem hasn&#39;t spoken directly about this artwork,  he has explained how some of his favorite drawings are the less formal ones:</p>
                            
                            <p><strong><i>“Some of my favorite drawings are the ones that feel like notes, not finished pieces.” </strong><a href="https://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/thibaud-herem-detail-filled-with-passion-illustration-260219" target="_blank">(It&#39;s Nice That,</i> 2019).</a></p>
                            
                            <p>That idea resonates strongly here—Korean Aperitif feels like something pulled from a travel  sketchbook, a quiet visual journal entry. In his interview for <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/bespoke-exclusive-collection-interviews-artist-thibaud-herem-on-how-his-intricate-landscapes-came-to-life-on-bespoke-panels" target="_blank"><i>Samsung Newsroom,</i></a> Hérem also discussed  how he enjoys drawing personal scenes with looser structure, especially those based on places he has visited.  Though subtle, this work reflects that side of his practice—where capturing a fleeting mood or visual  rhythm matters more than precision.</p>
