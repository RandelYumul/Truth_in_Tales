                            </div>
                            <div class="column dropcap">
                                <p>Some people view the decision not to have
                                children as selfish, as if avoiding the responsibility of parenthood somehow makes you less human. Even Pope Francis once remarked that the refusal of parenthood <strong>“diminishes us, it takes away our humanity”</strong> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-59884801" target="_blank">(BBC, 2022).</a></p>

                                <p>But let&#39;s pause and look at this more carefully.</p>

                                <p>Choosing not to have children isn&#39;t about rejecting responsibility, it&#39;s often about recognizing it. It&#39;s about acknowledging your limitations, whether emotional, financial, or mental, and making a thoughtful decision based on what&#39;s best for yourself and any potential child. <i>That&#39;s not selfish. That&#39;s self-aware. That&#39;s responsible.</i></p>

                                <p>What often goes unquestioned is the assumption that the reasons for having children are always pure and selfless. But that&#39;s not always the case. Some people, certainly not all, bring a child into the world just to have someone care for them in old age. That isn&#39;t an act of love, it&#39;s a transaction built on someone else's life. It may be culturally normalized, but that doesn&#39;t make it right.</p>
                                
                                <div class="desktop">
                                    <div class="blog3-image"> <img src="assets/PhotobySamsonKatt.jpg" alt="first pic"/>
                                    <p class="citation">Photo by Samson Katt: https://www.pexels.com/photo/calm-young-black-lady-resting-on-bed-with-adorable-dog-and-reading-novel-5255156/</p>
                                    </div>
                                </div>
                                

                                <p>Consider this: despite efforts to improve child welfare, child labor remains a harsh reality. According to the <a href="https://psa.gov.ph/statistics/labor-force-survey/child-labor-statistics/node/1684076259" target="_blank">Philippine Statistics Authority (2025),</a> there are still an estimated 863,000 working children between the ages of 5 and 17; children born into conditions that couldn&#39;t support them, now forced to work to survive. These aren&#39;t just numbers, they are the consequences of choices made without the resources or support a child deserves.</p>

                                <p class="yona_paragraph">And perhaps, the more difficult but necessary question is: <i><strong>Is it not more concerning to bring a child into the world knowing you are unprepared to meet their most basic needs?</strong></i> Parenthood is more than a desire; it is a profound responsibility. The ability to nurture, support, and sustain a child should weigh just as heavily as the wish to have one.</p>

                            </div>

                            <p>This isn&#39;t about blaming those who struggle, it&#39;s about recognizing that becoming a parent carries real-world consequences, not just for the adult, but for the life they bring into the world. In that light, choosing not to have children when you know you cannot provide stability, care, or opportunity is not selfish. It is an act of honesty, and perhaps even quiet compassion.</p>

                            <p>Writer <a href="https://jill.substack.com/p/actually-maybe-its-selfish-to-have" target="_blank">Jill Filipovic (2022)</a> notes that while not all reasons for wanting children are selfish, many are rooted in deeply personal desires such as fulfilling cultural or familial expectations, or continuing a family name or legacy. These motivations are entirely human. Wanting connection, continuity, or a sense of purpose is natural, and it doesn&#39;t make someone a bad person for choosing parenthood for those reasons.</p>

                            <p>But if we can acknowledge that people have children for personal, emotional, or practical reasons, then we must extend that same understanding to those who choose not to. The decision to remain child-free can be just as personal—shaped by emotional needs, financial realities, or a clear understanding of one&#39;s limits.</p>

                            <p>In both cases, the common thread is that people are making choices based on their realities, their truths. And if we can recognize the value in choosing parenthood, we must also recognize the value in choosing not to.</p>

                            <p>The truth is, parenthood isn&#39;t the only path to a meaningful life, and opting out of it doesn&#39;t make anyone less compassionate, less whole, or less human. The decision not to have children isn&#39;t a void, <i>it&#39;s a choice filled with intention, clarity, and often, deep care for what a child would have needed.</i></p>
