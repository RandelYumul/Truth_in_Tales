                    <p class="dropcap"><strong>Cancel culture. </strong> The mere mention of these two words sparks intense debate. In today&#39;s age of social media, where news spreads in seconds and almost nothing escapes the public eye, individuals&ndash;celebrity or not&ndash;are increasingly scrutinized for their words and actions. Cancel culture has become such a powerful tool to call out individuals for their wrongdoings. Some believe this is a way to hold people accountable. Others argue it&#39;s just another name for public shaming. So which one is it?</p>
                    <p>Originally, cancel culture was meant to establish a more direct and immediate form of public accountability. <a href="https://poj.peeters-leuven.be/content.php?url=article&id=3290737" target="_blank">Janssens and Spreeuwenberg (2022)</a> explained that it emerged as a way to confront harmful behavior&ndash;especially from those in power&ndash;that often went unnoticed or unpunished. At its core, it gave voice to the voiceless and pushed society to address issues that are often ignored. For instance, the <strong>#MeToo movement</strong> empowered individuals to call out abuse, most notably in the case of Harvey Weinstein. Social media became a platform where long-silenced voices could finally be heard. That public outcry eventually led to Weinstein&#39;s conviction <a href="https://www.ucf.edu/pegasus/is-cancel-culture-effective/#:~:text=The%20%23MeToo%20movement,becoming%20more%20intolerant." target="_blank">(Nicole Dudenhooefer, 2020).</a> In moments like this, cancel culture served its purpose-<strong>to shine a light where the system failed and to push for long&ndash;overdue accountability.</strong></p>
                     
                    <p class="no-margin">However, not all cancellations are rooted in justice. Sometimes, individuals are “canceled” over a post from years ago, jokes taken out of context, or unpopular opinions. In these cases, it becomes less about accountability and more about public shaming. Over time, the line between the two has become blurry.</p>

                            <p>In the K-pop industry, for example, idols like Kim Garam (former member of LE SSERAFIM) faced backlash over alleged past school bullying. The public outrage was so strong that she was immediately removed from the group just 18 days after their debut <a href="https://www.koreaboo.com/news/kim-wooseok-lee-jinhyuk-minzy-judge-thai-boy-group-audition-program-9low-top/" target="_blank">(Kim, 2022).</a> Similarly, idols have been “cancelled” for things they said or did years before their fame, sometimes leading to contract termination or permanent damage to their careers <a href="https://www.kpoppost.com/the-business-cost-of-cancel-culture-in-korean-entertainment/" target="_blank">(Jae, 2025).</a> These situations raise the question: <i>Are people truly being held accountable or are they simply being punished and denied the chance to grow and change?</i></p>

                    </div>
                </section>
                <section class="new-style alejandro-content">
                    <p>What started with good intentions has, in many ways, lost its way. A single mistake&ndash;whether recent or years old&ndash;can spiral into intense backlash. Reputations can be destroyed overnight. Careers ended. It demands perfection, leaving people no room for apology or growth. It overlooks the simple truth that people make mistakes and that growth takes time.</p>

                    <p>If someone <strong>speaks up</strong>, they&#39;re called <strong>fake. </strong>
                    <br>If they <strong>stay silent,</strong> they&#39;re deemed <strong>guilty.</strong>
                    <br>There is no in-between.
                    <br><strong><i>There is no winning.</i></strong></p>

                    <p>And that&#39;s where the real danger lies.</p>

                    <p>When used irresponsibly, cancel culture stops being about justice and starts becoming more about destruction. It silences rather than educates. It shames rather than guides. <i>What was once a tool meant to amplify the people&#39;s voice has now become a weapon to silence those we disagree with.</i></p>

                    <p>So, where do we go from here?</p>

                    <p>What we need isn&#39;t a culture of cancellation, but <strong>a culture of accountability with compassion.</strong> One that listens, corrects, and forgives when possible. One that holds people responsible, but also allows space to reflect, apologize, and grow. If we want a meaningful change, we need to ask ourselves: <i>Are we calling people out to help them grow or simply just to watch them fall?</i></p>
                        
                    <p>Maybe the answer isn't in silencing voices, but in listening to them. Because growth doesn&#39;t happen in silence and real change doesn't come from fear. It comes from reflection, from learning, and from giving people the chance to do better.</p>
